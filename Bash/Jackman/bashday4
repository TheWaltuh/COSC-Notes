-------------- BASH NOTES DAY 4 --------------



-------------- FOR LOOPS --------------


- pseudo-code

	for item in [LIST]

	do

	[COMMANDS]

	done


-------------- BREAK & CONTINUE --------------


break - terminates the current loop and passes program control to the statement tbat follows the terminated statement

continue - statements exits the current iteration of a loop and passes program control to the next iteration

-------------- WHILE AND UNTIL LOOPS --------------

while loop - used to perform a given set of commands an unknown number of times as long as true

until loop - used to execute a given set of commands as long as teh given condition becomes false

((counter++)) - increment by one

while | until 
do

done


-------------- LOOP EXAMPLES --------------

#!/bin/bash

#--Declare Functions
#--for loops
# List of names

names () {

  do
    echo $uSER
  done

}


#Basic range loop

range () {
  for NUMBER in {1..5}
  do
     echo $NUMBER
  done
}


#Range loops that counts down

team_rocket () {
for COUNT in {10..1}
do
  echo $COUNT
  sleep 1
done
echo "Team rocket Blasts Off Again!"

}

#For loop w/ counter

#For loop w/counter w/variables

countloop2 () {
   start=1
   end=5

   do
     echo $i
   done

}


#---While and Until Loops
#While loop
cents_or_dollars () {
  count=1
  while [[ $count -le 99 ]]
  do
    echo "Current cent counter: $count GySgt Gerwing: Makes sense right?"
    ((count++))
  done
  echo "Current Cent Counter $count Class: No Gunny, it makes a dollar!"

}

#Until loop
autobots () {
  count=10
  until [[ $count -eq 1 ]]
  do
    echo $count
    ((count--))
  done
  echo "Optimus Prime: Until that day, till all are one!"

-------------- ACTIVITIES --------------


16. Activity:

Design a script that detects the existence of directory: $HOME/.ssh

    Upon successful detection, copies any and all files from within the directory $HOME/.ssh to directory $HOME/SSH and produce no output. You will need to create $HOME/SSH.
    Upon un-successful detection, displays the error message "Run ssh-keygen" to the user.



*** answer 

DIR=$HOME/.ssh
if [ -d "$DIR" ];
then 
    cp -r $HOME/.ssh /$HOME/SSH
else
    echo "Run ssh-keygen"
fi


17. Activity:

    Write a script that determines your default gateway ip address. Assign that address to a variable using command substitution.
        NOTE: Networking on the CTFd is limited for security reasons. ip route and route are emulated. Use either of those with no arguments/switches.
    Have your script determine the absolute path of the ping application. Assign the absolute path to a variable using command substitution. HINT: man which
    Have your script send six ping packets to your default gateway, utilizing the path discovered in the previous step, and assign the response to a variable using command substitution.
    Evaluate the response as being either successful or failure, and print an appropriate message to the screen.



***answer

defgw=$(ip route | awk 'FNR == 1 {print}' | awk '{print $3}')
ping=$(which ping)
var=$($ping -c 6 $defgw)
if [[ "$var" =~ 100% ]]; then
    echo "failure"
else
    echo "successful"
fi


18. Activity:

    Create the following files in a new directory you create $HOME/ZIP:
        file1 will contain the md5sum of the text 12345
        file2 will contain the md5sum of the text 6789
        file3 will contain the md5sum of the text abcdef
    Create a zip file containing the three files above, without being stored inside a directory in the zip file. Name the zip file $HOME/ZIP/file.zip
        HINT: "Junk" the paths
    Utilize tar on $HOME/ZIP/file.zip to archive it into a file called $HOME/ZIP/file.tar.gz which should not include directories. Use the gzip option in tar, DO NOT use a seperate gzip binary.
        HINT: You might need an option to change directories first.



*** answer

mkdir $HOME/ZIP
echo '12345' | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file1
echo '6789' | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file2
echo 'abcdef' | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file3
cd $HOME/ZIP
zip -q -j $HOME/ZIP/file.zip file1 file2 file3
tar -zcf file.tar.gz file.zip



19. Activity:

Utilize Bash looping to iteratively create each user account and their directories.

    Design a basic FOR Loop that iteratively alters the file system and user entries in a passwd-like file for new users: LARRY, CURLY, and MOE.
    Each user should have an entry in the $HOME/passwd file
    The userid and groupid will be the same and can be found as the sole contents of a file with the user's name in the $HOME directory (i.e. $HOME/LARRY.txt might contain 123)
    The home directory will be a directory with the user's name located under the $HOME directory (i.e. $HOME/LARRY)
        NOTE: Do NOT use shell expansion when specifying this in the $HOME/passwd file.
    The default shell will be /bin/bash
    The other fields in the new entries should match root's entry
    Users should be created in the order specified


*** answer

for uSER in LARRY CURLY MOE
do
  mkdir $HOME/$uSER
  uid=$(head -1 $HOME/$uSER.txt)
  head -1 /etc/passwd | awk -F: -v "username=$uSER" -v "uid=$uid" -v "home=$uSER" 'OFS=":"{$1=username;$3=uid;
  $4=uid;$6="$HOME/"home;$7="/bin/bash"}{print}' >> $HOME/passwd
done


20. Activity:

    Write a bash script that will find all the files in the /etc directory, and obtains the octal permission of those files. The stat command will be useful for this task.
    Depending how you go about your script, you may find writing to the local directory useful. What you must seperate out from the initial results are the octal permissions of 0-640 and those equal to and greater than 642, ie 0-640 goes to low.txt, while 642 is sent to high.txt.
    Have your script uniquely sort the contents of the two files by count, numerically-reversed, and output the results, with applicable titles, to the screen. An example of the desired output is shown below.
        NOTE: There is a blank line being printed between the two sections of the output below.


*** answer

octvl=$(find /etc -type f 2>/dev/null -exec stat {} -c '%a' \;)
for i in $octvl
        do
                if [[ $i -ge 642 ]]; then echo $i >> high.txt
                else
                        echo $i >> low.txt
                fi
        done

high=$(cat high.txt)
low=$(cat low.txt)

echo "Files w/ OCTAL Perm Values 642+:"
echo "$high" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
echo ""
echo "Files w/ OCTAL Perm Values 0-640:"
echo "$low" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
