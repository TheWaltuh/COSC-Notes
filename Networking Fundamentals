--IPv4 Header
  version
  IHL - Internet Header Length
  DSCP - Differentiated Service Code Point
    ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification
      why is this typically zero and in what cases would a value be assigned to it
    Bit Shifting
      multiply by 4 or bit shift in order to get the actual value of the DSCP+ECN rather than just the DSCP value

---Transport Layer
  windows size is the size, in bytes, that the receiveing host can take (tcp sliding window)
  0x00 null scan, to see if the port is open
  0x3F christmas tree
---Session Layer
  maintain ongoing connections, does not exist for UDP, only for TCP
  Ports
    0 to 1023 well known
    1024 to 49151 registered
    49152 to 65535 Dynamic(Ephemeral)
  Protocols
    SOCKS
      initiate connections through a proxy
      on TCP port 1080
      client can provide authentication to the server
      client can request connections from the server
    NetBIOS
    PPTP/L2TP
      PPTP vulnerable way to make VPN tunnels on TCP port 1723
      L2TP does not provide encryption but rather relaies on other protocols on TCP port 1701
    RPC
