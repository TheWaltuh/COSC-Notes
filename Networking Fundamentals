----Basic Fundamentals
---Physical Layer
Data Treansmission and Reception
Encoding and Signaling
Physical Design and Specifications
---Data Link Layer
Ethernet Header (Frame)
  Destination Mac
  Source MAC
  Ethertype
    0x0800 IPv4
    0x0806 ARP
    0x86DD IPv6
    0x8100 VLAN Tag

---Network Layer
--IPv4 Header
  version
  IHL - Internet Header Length
  DSCP - Differentiated Service Code Point
    ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification
      why is this typically zero and in what cases would a value be assigned to it
    Bit Shifting
      multiply by 4 or bit shift in order to get the actual value of the DSCP+ECN rather than just the DSCP value

---Layer 2 Switching Technologies
---Layer 3 Routing Technologies
---Transport Layer
  windows size is the size, in bytes, that the receiveing host can take (tcp sliding window)
  0x00 null scan, to see if the port is open
  0x3F christmas tree
---Session Layer
  maintain ongoing connections, does not exist for UDP, only for TCP
  Ports
    0 to 1023 well known
    1024 to 49151 registered
    49152 to 65535 Dynamic(Ephemeral)
  Protocols
    SOCKS
      initiate connections through a proxy
      on TCP port 1080
      client can provide authentication to the server
      client can request connections from the server
    NetBIOS
    PPTP/L2TP
      PPTP vulnerable way to make VPN tunnels on TCP port 1723
      L2TP does not provide encryption but rather relaies on other protocols on TCP port 1701
    RPC
      Any Port
      request/response
        sends requests to a external server
        receives information for external server
        displays data to user
          XML
          JSON
    SMB/CIFS
      allows sharing files, printers, and other things
        SMABA and CIFS are different types of SMB
      SMB(Server Message Block) rides over NetBIOS
      Netbios Dgram Service - UDP 138
      Netbios Session Service - TCP 139
---Presentation Layer
  Translating
    translates data between what the network requires to the format of the computer
  Formatting
    readable format
  Excryption, and Compression of data
---Application Layer
  Applications and Services
    FTP (TCP 20/21)
      File Transfer Protocol
      Command and Data ports
      Active
        client initiates connection
        issues with NAT and Firewall
        complications with tunneling
      Passive
        client initiates both the command and data connections
--SSH TCP 22
  
--Telnet TCP 23
  remotely communicate but not secure
  can interact with an http server
  banner grabbing
--SMTP TCP 25
  for sending mail in-between mail servers
--TACACS TCP 49 and Raidus UDP 1645/1646 and 1812/1813
  authentication
--HTTP TCP 80
--HTTPS TCP 443
--POP TCP 110
  Post Office Protocol
--IMAP TCP 143
  Internet Message Access Protocol
--RDP TCP 3389
  Remote Desktop Protocol 
--DNS Query/Zone Transfer TCP/UDP 53
  Domain Name Server
--DHCP UDP 67/68
  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    Discover (client)
    Offer (server)
    Request (client)
    Accept (server)
  DHCPv6
    Solicit (client)
    Advertise (server)
    Request (client)
    Reply (server)
--TFTP UDP 69
  Trivial File Transfer Protocol
--NTP UDP 123
  Network Time Protocol
--SNMP UDP 161/162
  Simple Network Management Protocol
  Get-Request comes from the manager to the agent (Source IP = manager IP)
--RTP UDP above 1023
  Real-Time Transport Protocol
  streaming
