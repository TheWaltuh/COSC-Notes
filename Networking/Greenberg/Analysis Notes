### FINGERPRINTING ###
Fingerprinting aids in OS detection due to different implementations of network stack characteristics. Everything runs on TCP/IP protocols.
Active
  IDS may easily detect active scanning on a network
Passive
  do not generate any traffic and rely on analyzing existing traffic 

### P0F ###
---sudo which p0f
  /usr/sbin/p0f
## Format ##
  [module: direction]
## Signature Database ##
  more /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
---sudo p0f -r <pcap>
--Passively through traffic monitoring while interacting with the webserver 
  p0f -i <ethernet>
  wget <IP_Address>
  
### BASELINING ###
---7 days to estabalish the initial snapshot
---Verify ports and potocols used

### STATISTICS ###
---Protocol Hierarchy
  statistics>Protocol Hierarchy
  most used protocols and differences can be seen and compared
---Conversations
  statistics>conversations
  most to least talkitive computers and any new conversations
----Endpoints
  statistics>endpoints
  each computer and their statistics and show any new computers, and anormal traffic
---I/O Graph
  statistics>io graph
  time periods during the capture and baseline normal to abnormal traffic
---IPv4 and IPv6 statistics
  statistics>IPv6>All addresses
  packet breakdown per address and will show any durastic changes
---Expert Information
  analyze>expert information
  used as guidance to see where to start looking

### WIRESHARK ###
# FILTER - tcp contains "password"               # shows all tcp packets that contains password
# FILTER - !(tcp contains "password")            # shows all tcp packets that does not contain password
TimeStamps are important
### TCPDUMP ###
# COMMAND - sudo tcpdump -r practice.pcap "tcp[13] = 0x02" | awk '{print $3}' | cut -d. -f1,2,3,4 | sort -n | uniq     # Finds every uniq ip address sending syn flags
