  Netowrk Scanning
    Remote to Local
      outside of a specific network performing some sort of scan oh internal hosts
    Local to Remote
      a host within the network scans outside of the network
    Local to Local
      a host scans there internal network
    Remote to Remote
      world wide scanning campaigns
    Approach
      wide range scan
      target specific scan
    Method
      single source scan
      distributed scan
Passive - OCO :: client listens for traffic from the target -- DCO :: watches the network and looks for irregular traffic

:::: PASSIVE EXTERNAL DEMO ::::
  whois google
  dig ccboe.net
    dig ccboe.net MX ## Looks for the Mail Server
    dig ccboe.net SOA ## Looks for the Source of Authority Server
    dig ccboe.net TXT ## Text files, or some sort of text (could be in base 64)
    dig ccboe.net NS ## Gets the name servers for the website
    dig ccboe.net A ## IPv4
    dig ccboe.net AAAA ## IPv6
    dig ccboe.net CNAME ## Gets the Canonical Name record
  dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me

:::: NETWORK SCANNING DEMO ::::
  nmap -Pn <IPADDRESS> or <IPSUBNET>  ## -P turns of ping sweep :: -n no name resolution
    nmap -Pn <IPADDRESS> or <IPSUBNET> -p 21-23,80 -T4 | egrep -i "open|Nmap scan" ## Quick Port Scan
  nc -zv <IPADDRESS> <PORT> or <SERVICENAME> ## -z port scanning :: -v verbose :: -vv more verbose
    nc -vznw1 <IPADDRESS> 1-1023 ## quick scan to see if ports are open
    nc <IPADDRESS> 80
      GET /
    nc <IPADDRESS> 23 ## is a bunch of gibberish
