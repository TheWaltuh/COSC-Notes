============ DAY 5 NETWORKING NOTES ============

	      NETWORK ENUMERATION
		

types of recon:

Active:
	Active scanning is the process of transmitting packets to a remote host and analyzing corresponding replies to locate and 		identify devices

Passive:
	On the offensive side, the client listens for beacons and other traffic sent periodically by a target. On the defensive side, 		passive scanning can be done using an IDS, it watches the network and look for irregular traffic or other indicators of 		compromise. A passive scan generally takes more time, since the client must listen and wait for traffic versus actively probing

Internal:
	From inside your network, an internal vulnerability scan operates inside your networks* Key Loggers firewall to identify real 		and potential vulnerabilities inside your network

External:
	From outside your network, looks for holes in your network firewall, where malicious outsiders can break in and attack your 	network.

NETWORK SCANNING

**scanning approach

	aim
	   - wide range target scan
	   - target specific scan
	   
	method
	   - single source scan
	   - distributed scan
	   
types of scans:

-broadcast ping & ping sweep
-ARP scan
-SYN scan
-full connect scan
-null scan
-FIN scan
-XMAS tree scan
-UDP scan	
-ACK/window scan
-RPC scan
-FTP scan
-decoy scan
-OS finger printing
-version scan
-protocol ping
-discovery probes


syntax:
(sudo) nmap <options> <target ip(s)/subnet>
	-n   - no name resolution
	-P   - disable ping
	-p-  - scans all ports
	
nmap examples

	nmap -Pn 10.10.0.33-36,39 - scan hosts with no name resolution or ICMP ping
	nmap -Pn 10.10.0.40/27 -p 21-23,80 -T4 | egrep -i "open|nmap scan"

netcat examples 

	nc -zvnw1 10.10.0.40 21-23,80 - scan to see if these ports are open
		-z	zero-I/O mode used for scanning
		-v	verbose
		-n 	numeric
		-w	secs for timeout connects
	
	nc 10.10.0.40 22 - banner grab
	
	echo "GET /" | nc 10.10.0.40 80 - banner grab (html)

NET RECON METHODOLOGY
1. Host Discovery (nmap, scan.sh, nc, ping sweep)
2. Port Discovery (nmap, scan.sh, nc)
3. Port Validation (e.g Banner Grabbing - nc)
4. Follow-on Actions (based on ports found)
 a. if port is 21 or 80: wget -r [ ftp://IP_ADDRESS -or- IP_ADDRESS]
 b. if port is 22 or 23: connect to it and do PASSIVE RECON


SCAN METHODOLOGY



PASSIVE RECON METHODOLOGY
1. hostname
2. Interfaces and Subnets? ip a, ifconfig
3. Neighbors? arp -a, ip neigh | egrep -iv "fail" | awk '{print $1}' (don't care about "fail")
4. Files of Interest (pcacps,flags, etc)? find command helpful
