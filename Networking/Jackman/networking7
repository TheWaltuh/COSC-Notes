============ DAY 7 NETWORKING NOTES ============

fingerprinting and host indentification
	P0F(passive os fingerprinting)
	-look at variations in intitial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options
	-configuration stored in: /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
	
syntax:

sudo p0f -r <file> (run against a file)


things to look for
	protocol hierarchy
	conversations
	endpoints
	I/O graph
	ipv4 and ipv6 statistics
	expert information
	
	
	display filter: 'tcp contains "password"'
	
	instead of not != encompass the whole filter in () and put ! in front
	
	
tcpdump

sudo tcpdump -r <pcap>	


data collection devices
	sensors
	- in-line
	- passive

methods of data collection
	TAP
	SPAN
	ARP spoofing (MitM)

anomaly detection
indicator of attack (IOA)
	proactive
	a series of actions that are suspecious together
	focus of intent 
	looks for what musc happen
		


indicators
	.exe/executable files
	NOP sled
	repeated letters
	well know signature
	mismatched protocols
	unusual traffic
	large amounts of traffic/ unusual times

indicators of attack

	destinations
	ports
	public servers/DMZs
	off-hour
	network scans
	alarm events
	malware reinfection

potential indicators of comporomise

	unusual traffic outbound
	anomalous user login or account use 
	size of responses for HTML
	high number of requests for the same file 
	using non-standard ports/ apllication port mismatch
	writing changes to the registry/system files
	
types of malware

	adware/spyware
		large ammounts of traffic
		IOA
			destinations
		IOC
			unusual traffic outbound
	virus
		phishing/ watering hole
	
	worm 
		phishing/watering hole
		IOA
			alarm events
		IOC
			changes to registry/system files
	trojan
		beaconing

	rootkit
		IOA
			malware reinfection
		IOC
			anomalous user login/account use
	backdoor
		IOA
			remote logins
			
	botnets
		large amounts of ips
		IOA
			destinations, remote logins
		IOC
			unusual tasks, anomalous user login/account use
	Polymorphic and metamorphic malware
		depends on the malware's type/class


decoding
	enca
	chardet
