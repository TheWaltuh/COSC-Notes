============ DAY 9 NETWORKING NOTES ============

Acess Control List

work in layers 3 and 4


filters traffic on a router or a layer 3 switch

standard filters filter only on the traffic type (TCP,UDP,etc) - these are set closest to the destination
if you have one set on an interface blocking traffic to a network it is outbound because it is blocking traffic coming into the network

extended ACLs can filter on traffic source, destination and protocol (via port numbers) - these are set closest to the source




Intrusion Detection & prevention systems

IDS only logs suspicious network traffic, IPS will log and drop suspicious traffic

	placement:
		-in line
		-or not
	recognition methods:
		-signature
		-heuristic aka behavioral


snort rule syntax:

[action] [protocol] [s.ip] [s.port] [direction] [d.ip] [d.port] ( match conditions ;)

action 	  	- such as alert, log, pass, drop, reject
protocol 	  	- includes TCP, UDP, ICMP and others
source ip 	  	- single address, CIDR notation, range, or any
source port 	  	- one, multiple, any, or range
direction 	  	- either inbound or in and outbound
destination ip	  	- options mirror source ip
destination port  	- options mirror source port


snort ids/ips general rule:

msg		- human readable alert message
reference	- links to external source of the rule
sid		- used to uniquely identify snort rules
rev		- uniquely identify revisions of snort rules
classtype	- used to describe what a successful attack would do
priority	- level of concern(1-really bad,2-badish,3-informational)
metadat	- allows a rule writer to embed additional information about the rule


snort ids/ips payload detection options:

content	- looks for a string of text
|binary data|	- to look for a string of binary HEX
nocase		- modified content, makes it case insensitive
depth		- specift how many bytes into a packet snort should search for the specified pattern
distance 	- how far into a packet snort should ignore before starting to search for the specified pattern relative to the end of the previous pattern match
within 	- modifier that makes sure that at most N bytes are between pattern matches using the content keyword
offset 	- skips a certain number of bytes before searching


snort ids/ips non-payload detection options:

Flow 	- direction (to/from client and server) and state of connection (established, stateless, stream/no stream)
ttl 	- The ttl keyword is used to check the IP time-to-live value.
tos 	- The tos keyword is used to check the IP TOS field for a specific value.
ipopts	- The ipopts keyword is used to check if a specific IP option is present
seq 	- check for a specific TCP sequence number
ack 	- check for a specific TCP acknowledge number.
flags 	- The flags keyword is used to check if specific TCP flag bits are present.
itype 	- The itype keyword is used to check for a specific ICMP type value.
icode 	- The icode keyword is used to check for a specific ICMP code value.


Snort IDS/IPS Post detection options:

logto		- The logto keyword tells Snort to log all packets that trigger this rule to a special output log file.
session 	- The session keyword is built to extract user data from TCP Sessions.
react 		- This keyword implements an ability for users to react to traffic that matches a Snort rule by closing connection and sending a notice.
tag 		- The tag keyword allow rules to log more than just the single packet that triggered the rule.
activates 	- This keyword allows the rule writer to specify a rule to add when a specific network event occurs.
activated_by 	- This keyword allows the rule writer to dynamically enable a rule when a specific activate rule is triggered.
count 		- Allows the rule writer to specify how many packets to leave the rule enabled for after it is activated.


Snort IDS/IPS Thresholding and suppression options:

type [limit | threshold | both]
	limit alerts on the 1st event during defined period then ignores the rest.
	Threshhold alerts every [x] times during defined period.
	Both alerts once per time internal after seing [x] amopunt of occurances of event. It then ingores all other events during period.
	
track [by_src | by_dst] - rate is tracked either by source IP address, or destination IP address
count [#] 		 - number of rule matching in [s] seconds that will cause event_filter limit to be exceeded
seconds [seconds] 	 - time period over which count is accrued. [s] must be nonzero value



DEMO:

file location

/etc/snort

	/rules - directory of pre-written rules
	/snort.conf - config file
	
check snort's version:0

sudo snort -V

start snort:

sudo snort -D -l /var/log/snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

*** if command doesn't work something is wrong with the conf file and you can troubleshoot with:
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

gives log location and conf file location for snort:

ps -elf | grep snort


you can look in /var/log/snort to find snort generated logs(stored in pcaps)
use you use tcpdump -r to view 

sudo tcpdump -Xvvvntr /var/log/snort/snort.log<number>

sudo tcodumo -tnr /var/log/snort/snort.log<number> | awk '{print $2} {print $4}' | sort | sed 's/:$//' | uniq -c

sudo snort -r /var/log/snort/snort.log<number>

attacking & evading ids/ips( based on delta between devices )

insertion attack:
	-ids accepts packet
	-host will not accept packets
evasion attacking:
	-ids does ont accept packet 
	-host will accept packet
