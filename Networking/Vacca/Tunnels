Port Forwarding:
  2 Types (Local, Remote) have to do with where the port is being opened
  
  ssh user@H1 -L 1111:H2:22 -NT
  ssh -p 1111 user@localhost
  ssh -p 1111 user@localhost -L 2222:H3:80
  wget localhost:2222

  ssh user@H1 -L 1111:H2:80
  wget localhost:1111

  To connect to a filtered port:
    ssh user@H1 -L 1111:H2:22 -NT
    ssh -p 1111 user@localhost -L 2222:localhost:80
                      ^                 ^
                      IH                H2
