CAPSTONE OP NOTES:

55 questions total.

DO ON EVERY HOST!
    net recon method:
    1. Host Discovery (nmap, scan.sh, nc, ping sweep)
    2. ports discovery (nmap, nc, scan.sh)
    3. Port validation, banner grabbing (nc, nmap -A)
    4. follow on actions (based on ports found)
        4a. if 21 or 80, use 'wget -r ftp(http)://<ip>'
        4b. if 22 or 23, connect to it and perform passive recon steps (see passive recon)
    5. record results, take op notes
        
    scan method:
    1. quick scan ports: 21-23,80
    2. scan ports based on specific intel/found
    3. well known ports: 1-1023
    4. scan in chunks of 2000, or first 10,000
    5. last resort, scan everything.

    Passive recon method:
    perform while on machines to learn about that machine.
    CHECK FIRST: "/usr/share/cctc/"
    1. hostname
    2. interfaces and subnets
        ip a
        ifconfig
        ipconfig
    3. Find neighbors
        arp -a
        ip neigh (take note of MAC and interface it comes off of. )
        Find more...
    4. Files of interest:
        PCAPS, FLAGS, .txt, config files (persistence), 
        ** 'find' is useful. 
    5. other ports listening: netstat -or- 'ss -nltp'
    6. avalible tools
        'sudo which tcpdump wireshark nmap telnet wget curl'
    7. look for creds in the clear. user TCPDump to look for telnet traffic.



START FLAG: crowning achievement
Floating IP of start pivot is: 10.50.30.255
creds:
    user: net3_student19
    pass: password19
    
    ALWAYS CHECK
"/usr/share/cctc/" directory. This is where any/all files of interest or instructions will be provided.

Authorized port range:
 31900-31999

From 10.1.1.30:
    hint-01a.png:
        This system seems to be a pivot for the Network Fundamentals and Programming Sections.

From 10.1.1.11:
hint-02a.png:
    There is a webservice running on the port that corresponds with the RFC that giverns ipv4 addressing.
hint-02b.png:
    There is a PCAP saved in the share folder of this machine that you should look at.
    ON PORT 1918 THERE ARE INDEX-X.html FILES THAT ARE FLAGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    
    
10.1.1.25:
    hint-03a.png:
        There is a webservice running on the port that correstponds with the RFC that giverns ipv4 header structure
        
    hint-03b.png:
        There is a listening TCP port on this system that waiting for connections.
        Build a Python3 Stream sender and send it though your tunnel to say Hi.
        Send your message as a bytes like object and decode the response to/from UTF-8 to get the human readable message.
        
    ON PORT 791 THERE ARE INDEX-X.html FILES THAT ARE FLAGS!!!!!!!!!!!


10.1.1.33:
    hint-04a.png:
        There is another box (Capstone05) on a different network (that only this system can see.). Try to attack this box.
        On one of the ports assocuated with the W32/Blaster Worm. Use a sniffing tool to try and find the message it is trying to send.
        
I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN

        
    hint-04b.png:
        RIPv2 seems to be running on the 10.1.1.0/25 network.
        Try to sniff out the traffic to find out what networks its advertising in its updates.
        What you find will be the ip address of the next environment pivot to access from INTERNET_HOST

        SSH is running on a rhp, not accessible from outside (I'll need a reverse ssh tunnel)
        It also uses different creds. how can i get them from the outside?
        Maybe another system tool can help me.
        The Flag for this system is the password I find converted to BASE64
        Credentials for this system will be exactly what you find.
