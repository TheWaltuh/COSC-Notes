calculator  -  programming mode, lets you do binary math, bit shifts, etc.


===============Networking Fundmentals===================

bit         -- 1 or 0, flag
nibble      -- 4 bits, one hex character
byte        -- 8 bits, octet
half word   -- 16 bits, 2 bytes
word        -- 32 bits



Encapsulation and Decapsulation:
Data is passed down from each layer with headers and footers added on, creating a kind of layer approach to networking.

OSI Model- 

Layer 1: Physical layer
    Actual transmission,
    hardware,
    encoding and signaling
    PDU  -  Bits
    common protocols  -  Bluetooth, USB, 802.11 (Wi-Fi), DSL, 1000Base-T


Layer 2: Data Link Layer
    MAC (Media Access Control)
    LLC (Logical Link Control)
    interface of software and hardware (logical and physical)
    PDU  -  Frames
    Common protocols  -  PPP, ATM, 802.2/3 Ethernet, Frame Relay
    
    CAM Table  -  machine readable table of interfaces and known MAC addresses. 
    
    Ethernet Header  -  
        Destination MAC     -   6 bytes
        source MAC          -   6 bytes
        (vlan tag goes here, 4 bytes, double tagging)
        ethertype           -   2 bytes
            values:
                0x0800 - IPv4
                0x0806 - ARP
                0x86DD - IPv6
                0x8100 - VLAN Tagging 802.1q


    Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)  -  Root decision process
        1) elect root bridge
        2) Identify the root portss on non-root bridge
        3) Identify the Designatied port for each segment
        
        STP prevents loops, or switching loop:
        
        Layer 2 Discovery Protocols:
            Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
            Foundry Discovery Protocol (FDP)
            Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)
            
        Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP):
            Trunk:
                preestablished connection between 2 switches or a switch and a roter to keep VLANs connected without wasting ports. 
                ** think of it as a type of tunnel.
            
            DTP dynamically creates trunks, so they don't have to be created manually.
            
        
        VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP):
            Configure vlan once and send it around to everyone instead of having to do convergence
            based on revision number  -  highest number wins
            
        
    Port Security: 
        What to do if I see a new MAC address on any given port. 
        There are 3 basic responses. 
        modes:
            shutdown  -- permanant
            restrict  -- temporary
            protect  --  do nothing, but log it.
            
                
    

Layer 3: Networking Layer
    Uses Routers 
    PDU  -  packet
    
    routing table
        shows route to different ranges of IPs.
        also shows default route (gateway of last resort.)
     
    lookup process:
        Router looks for longest match in the routing table.
        
    routed vs routing protocol:
        routed:
            Allows routers to transfer data
        routing:
            transfer info about routes
    
    First Hop redundancy protocols:
        ????
        
    Administrative Distance:
        lower is higher priority:
        The AD represents the "trustworthiness" of the route; the lower the AD, the more trustworthy the route source.
        
        0 - directly connected
        1 - static
        5 - EIGRP Summary route
        20 - External BGP
        etc... (look in FG)
        
    Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
        Largest packet size before we have to fragment packets.
        
    
    Dynamic Routing:
        Interior:
            Talking within networks I control
                IGP -> RIP(v1, v2), IGRP(EIGRP), etc...
        Exterior:
            Talking with external networks
                EGP -> Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
            
    Uses IPv4 and IPv6
        IPv4 Header:
            useful info:
                Source IP addr
                Destination addr
                flags
                fragment offset
                Time to Live
    
        IPv6 Header:
            is larger than IPv4 header
            usefil info:
                no more fragmentation. Uses Flow label instead
                source address
                destination address
                Traffic class.
                
    
    Link State:
        Tells me the best route based on bandwith or medium of the connections. 
        Less hops isn't always the best. 
        
    
    Fragmentation:
        DF - don't fragment
        MF - May fragment  --  there will be an offset except for the first packet.    
                                There will be more fragments incoming.
                                MF is 0 when there are no more packet frags.
        Offset - 
        Refrence the MIRO for formulas to find offset.
        
        
    Fingerprinting:
        TTL
            Linux: 64
            Windows: 128
            Cisco: 255
        
        Window size:
            refrence FG
            

    ICMP--
        I C(see) MY PROBLEM
        ICMP is used for troubleshooting.
