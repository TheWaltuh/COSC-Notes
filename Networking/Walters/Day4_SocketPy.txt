Python Socket Programming.


Socket types:

stream sockets  -- Connection oriented, sequenced, TCP,SCTP,Bluetooth
Datagram Sockets  -- Connectionless, UDP
Raw Sockets  -- Direct sending and receiving of IP packets without automatic protocol-specific formatting.

stream and datagram are in user space.
raw sockets are in user space.


user space applications/sockets:
    tcpdump/wireshark to read a file
    nmap with no switches
    using netcat to connet to a listener
    using netcat to create a listener on an unprivileged port (1024+)
    using /dev/tcp or /dev/udp to transmit data.
    

Kernel space application/sockets:
    using tcpdump or wireshark to captrue packets on the wire.
    using nmap for OS identification to set specific flags.
    using nc on ports 1-1023
    using scapy to craft/modify packets
    using Python to craft or modify raw sockets
    network devices using routing protocols
    
    
Python:

s = socket.socket(socket.<FAMILY>, socket.<TYPE>, socket.<PROTOCOL>)

family:
    AF_INET  - ipv4
    AF_INET6 - ipv6
    
type:
    SOCK_STREAM  - stream socket, TCP
    SOCK_DGRAM   - datagram socket, UDP
    SOCK_RAW     - Raw socket

Protocol:
    IPPROTO_RAW  - ??
    (default is 0)


other modules:
    struct
    sys
