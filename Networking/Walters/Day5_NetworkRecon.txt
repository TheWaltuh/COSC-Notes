DAY 5

QUOTE FOR THE DAY:
    "AUTISTIC IS A SUPERPOWER IN CYBER"

===============NETWORK RECONNAISSANCE===================

flat network  - network not divided up at all. Lots of visiblility for enemies if they get onto any machine.



recon types:
    active
    passive
    internal
    external
    
    wayback machine
    netcraft 

    subdomains: 
    

    arp -a
    route
    ip/if config
    ss / netstat
    (passive external, OSINT)
    
    whois  - does a dns lookup
    dig  - pull the dns records WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN
    
    shodan  - search engine for info about ips and stuff.
    
    
    
    
    
    
==============NETWORK SCANNING=====================
    
    Remote to Local
        external looking into a network
        very common for pentesting or OCO
    
    Local to Remote
        scan systems outside the network.
        Leads to legal trouble
        
    Local to Local
        scanning a network from inside the network
        You can scan your own network
        
    Remote to Remote    
        
        
        
    approach:
        Aim
            wide range target scan 
            Target specific scan
        Method
            Single source
            Distributed
            
            
            

Stratagies:
    Broadcast ping and ping sweep..
    ARP Scan
    SYN  - half open
    Full connect  - creates tcp connection
    Null scan  - no flags set
    FIN scan  - FIN flag set
    XMAS tree scan  - all flags set
    UDP scan  - scan with UDP header

scan types:
    ACK/Windows scan
    RPC scan
    FTP scan
    decoy scan
    OS fingerprinting scan
    version scan
    Protocol pin
    Discovery probes


Syntax: 
    (sudo) nmap <options> <target ip(s)/subnet>
        -n  - no name resolution
        -P  - disable ping
        -p  - specify ports
        -p-   will scan all ports
        -T<num 1-5> - controls the speed of the scan.
        
    nc <options> <target ip> <target port>
        -h  - gives you list of options
        -n  - numeric ip only
        -v  - verbose, vv also works
        -w<seconds> - reduce the wait time to a specified value
        -z  - zero IO mode, Used for scanning.



nmap examples:

    nmap -Pn 10.10.0.40  - scan host with no name resolution and no ICMP ping
    nmap -Pn 10.10.0.50 -T4  - runs the scan faster
    nmap -Pn 10.10.0.40/27 | egrep -i 'open|Nmap scan'  - look for only open ports
    

netcat examples: 
    
    nc 10.10.0.40 21-23,40  - banner grab for those ports
    nc -zvnw1 10.10.0.40 21-23,80  - scan to see if these ports are open.
    nc 10.10.0.40 23  - banner grab for telnet






network mapping:

you should have all endpoints and networking devices on your nework map.
put all content of interest, open ports, OS, Creds, IP, hostname, 

Tool:
    draw.io
    
what information to include in map:
        hostname
        ip(s)
        Ports 
        Tools (nmap, nc, tcpdump, wireshark, ssh, telnet)
            **use which to locat tools on boxes.




net recon method:
1. Host Discovery (nmap, scan.sh, nc, ping sweep)
2. ports discovery (nmap, nc, scan.sh)
3. Port validation, banner grabbing (nc, nmap -A)
4. follow on actions (based on ports found)
    4a. if 21 or 80, use 'wget -r ftp(http)://<ip>'
    4b. if 22 or 23, connect to it and perform passive recon steps (see passive recon)
5. record results, take op notes
    
scan method:
1. quick scan ports: 21-23,80
2. scan ports based on specific intel/found
3. well known ports: 1-1023
4. scan in chunks of 2000, or first 10,000
5. last resort, scan everything.

Passive recon method:
perform while on machines to learn about that machine.

1. hostname
2. interfaces and subnets
    ip a
    ifconfig
    ipconfig
3. Find neighbors
    arp -a
    ip neigh (take note of MAC and interface it comes off of. )
    Find more...
4. Files of interest:
    PCAPS, FLAGS, .txt, config files (persistence), 
    ** 'find' is useful. 
5. other ports listening: netstat -or- 'ss -nltp'
6. avalible tools
    'sudo which tcpdump wireshark nmap telnet wget curl'
7. look for creds in the clear. user TCPDump to look for telnet traffic.
