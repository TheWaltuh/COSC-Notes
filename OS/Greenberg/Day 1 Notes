###WQL for WMI for CIM Classes
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_product -Filter 'name like "microsoft%"' #What is the %?
EXAMPLE 4: Any characters -- or none (%)

The following commands get processes that have names that begin with
"calc". The % symbol in WQL is equivalent to the asterisk (*) symbol in
regular expressions.

    $query = "Select * from win32_Process where Name LIKE 'calc%'"
    Get-WmiObject -Query $query | Select-Object -Property Name, ProcessID

    Name                               ProcessID
    ----                               ---------
    calc.exe                                4424
WQL is the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) query language, which is the language used to get information from WMI.
