htop then press F5
grep UID /etc/login.defs
ps -eo cmd,pid,euid,ruid          #how to view pid,euid,and ruid of processes running

fork() the kernel creates a nearly identical copy of the process
exec() the kernel starts the program, replacing the current process

Orphan process - parent process exited, adopted by /sbin/init with PPID of 1
  all daemons are orphans
  disown -a && exit  #forces all children to be adopted
Zombie - completed process, but has an entry in the process table, waiting for the parent to awknowledge or terminate
  cannot be killed with kill, unless the parent process is killed
A fork bomb (also known as a “rabbit virus”) is a denial of service (DoS) attack in which the fork system call is 
  recursively used until all system resources execute a command. 
kill -l       #lists all singal commands such as kill -9 and so on

ps --ppid 2 -lf               #lists all process with a parent process id of 2 (kernel)
ps --ppid 2 -Nlf              #does the aboce but doesn't list the ppid
ps -elf --forest              #shows a process tree of child and parent processes

persistence in daemons - they are a service that should run for duration of system operations, it would require a shutdown for parent process to die
malicious processes are sometimes orphaned and named to make it look like a daemon 

jobs                  #list of jobs running in the background
fg or bg              #push/pull jobs to and from the foreground and background
kill %<job number>    #terminate process by job number
kill -9 <pid> 
pkill -9 <process name>
SIGSTOP(19) - lets you pause the process to continue later
SIGTERM(15) - terminates the process, executes shutdown taks, proper way of terminating a process
SIGKILL(9) - only use if SIGTERM doesn't work, kills process without proper shutdown

Cron Jobs - scheduled tasks a way for adversaries to set persistence
/var/spool/cron
/etc/cron.d
System Cron Jobs
  controlled by /etc/crontab
  system-wide maintaince tasks
User Cron Jobs
  CMD: crontab
  stored in /var/spool/cron/crontabs
  crontab -u [user] file - sets user's crontab file to contents of listed file
  crontab -l -u [user] - user's crontab contents
  crontab -r -u [user] - removes user's contrab contents
  crontab -e -u [user] - edits user's crontab contents
cat /etc/crontab
