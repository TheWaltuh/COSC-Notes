fork() the kernel creates a nearly identical copy of the process
exec() the kernel starts the program, replacing the current process

Orphan process - parent process exited, adopted by /sbin/init with PPID of 1
all daemons are orphans
disown -a && exit  #forces all children to be adopted
Zombie - completed process, but has an entry in the process table, waiting for the parent to awknowledge or terminate
cannot be killed with kill, unless the parent process is killed
A fork bomb (also known as a “rabbit virus”) is a denial of service (DoS) attack in which the fork system call is 
recursively used until all system resources execute a command. 
kill -l       #lists all singal commands such as kill -9 and so on

ps --ppid 2 -lf               #lists all process with a parent process id of 2 (kernel)
ps --ppid 2 -Nlf              #does the aboce but doesn't list the ppid
ps -elf --forest              #shows a process tree of child and parent processes
