=========== OS DAY 4 NOTES ============

***windows boot process




1.

-BIOS and UEFI are firmware that ensure critical hardware like SATA devices (Hard Drives), Display Adapters, and SDRAM(Synchronous dynamic random-access memory) are functional then, locates the MBR(Master Boot Record) or GPT(GUID Partition Tables).


why UEFI is better:

UEFI Boots much faster than BIOS systems, especially for Windows machines.
UEFI Firmware is usually loaded into flash memory or EEPROM, making it easier to update and patch.
UEFI offers SECURED BOOT mode which only allows verified drivers to load.
UEFI offers drive support of up to 9 zettabytes, while BIOS only works with 2 terabytes.



2.

-Once the BIOS checks hardware, it finds the MBR (Master Boot Record). The MBR contains Disk Partitions like /dev/sda1 or DISK 1 C:\

-The partition contains code that starts the first stage of loading an Operating System, called a Boot Loader

	Boot Loaders
		-Windows 2003 and older used NTLDR or New Technology Loader
		-Windows 7 Service Pack 1 and newer uses bootmgr or New Technology Loader

-From this point the Boot Loader takes over and starts the Operating System
