=========== OS DAY 6 NOTES ============

- USER ACCOUNT CONTROL(UAC)
	reg key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System


- UAC prompts are color coded
	Red - Application or publisher blocked by group policy
	Blue & gold - Administrative application
	Blue - Trusted and Authenticode signed application
	Yellow - Unsigned or signed but not trusted application

- 3 TYPES OF EXC LVLS

asInvoker - The application will run with the same permissions as the process that started it. The application can be elevated to a higher permission level by selecting Run as Administrator.

Ex: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe

requireAdministrator - The application will run with administrator permissions. The user who starts the application must be a member of the Administrators group. If the opening process is not running with administrative permissions, the system will prompt for credentials.

highestAvailable - The application will run with the highest permission level that it can. If the user who starts the application is a member of the Administrators group, this option is the same as requireAdministrator. If the highest available permission level is higher than the level of the opening process, the system will prompt for credentials.

Ex: C:\Windows\regedit.exe

- AUTOELEVATE SETTING

.\sigcheck -m <path>

.\strings -s <path\*.exe> | findstr /i autoelevate


Some Windows executables can "auto elevate" without a prompt.

Files that have "auto elevate" in their permissions will not prompt UAC
