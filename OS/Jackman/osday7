=========== OS DAY 7 NOTES ============



*VIEWING PROCESSES


- ls -elf 	#to view and format processes
	e - all processes
	l - long format
	f - full format

#all kernel processes are forked off of [kthreadd] PID=2	*brackets mean kernel process
#all user processes are forked off of /sbin/init   PID=1


- htop		#live viewing of processes


*OS PROTECTION

ring 3	#least privilege, applications

ring 2	#device drivers

ring 1	#device drivers

ring 0	#most privilege, kernel


grep UID /etc/login.defs	#range of user IDs for system and human users



*SYSTEM CALL

		      --> shell<3>
                     |
shell<1> --> fork<2> |
		      --> copy of shell<4> --> exec(ls)<5> --> ls<6>
		      
		    
*SIGNALS

#signals are interrupts sent to a program to indicate that an important event has occured

kill -l	#shows are signals available for kill command

ps --ppid 2 -lf |  head					#show only [kthreadd] processes

ps --ppid 1 -Nlf					#exclude that ppid

ps -elf --forest | tail				#display output in ascii tree

[ps -o ppid= -p <pid>, then run ps -e | grep <pid>]	#find parent process 


zombie process	#process whose execution is copleted but still has a entry in process table.
orphan process	#parent process is dead and it gets adopted by /sbin/init


*CRONJOBS

#cron jobs can be used to establish persistence

two types:

system
	run as root and rigidly scheduled
	perform system-wide maintenance tasks (Cleaning out /tmp or rotating logs)
	controlled by /etc/crontab

user
	Use 'crontab’ command to create user cron jobs
	stored in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/


crontab -u [user] file This command will load the crontab data from the specified file

crontab -l -u [user] This command will display/list user’s crontab contents

crontab -r -u [user] This Command will remove user’s crontab contents

crontab -e -u [user] This command will edit user’s crontab contents

-sudo lsof -c sshd	#List all open files for a specific process.


interpretting descriptors:

# - The number in front of flag(s) is the file descriptor number used by the process associated with the file
u - File open with Read and Write permission
r - File open with Read permission
w - File open with Write permission
W - File open with Write permission and with Write Lock on entire file
mem - Memory mapped file, usually for share library
