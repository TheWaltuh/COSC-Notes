FIND EVIL OP NOTES::


FindEVIL1:

Scenario: The Villains group has been chanting offerings to their new leader at regular intervals over a TCP connection.

Task: Identify their method of communication and how it is occurring. Locate the following artifacts: ** The chant/text used by each villain (include spaces) ** The new Lord receiving the offering ** The IP address and port that the offering is received over

Flag format: chant text,new Lord,IP:port

Machine: Minas_Tirith

Solution:
there is a text file in every user's home folder with chant text in it. They're all the same. 
witch_king was the only one who didn't have a chant, but he did have a bash script that opened port 9999.
I found the ip with netstat -ano.
The chants were executed by a cronjob that executed a bash script called offering. 







/bin/bash -c netcat -lp 3389 < /tmp/NMAP_all_hosts.txt
