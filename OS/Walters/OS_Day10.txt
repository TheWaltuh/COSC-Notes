**AD supports one set of password and account lockout policies for a domain. Beginning in Windows Server 2008, you can override the default password and account lockout policies in a domain using Fine-Grained Password Policies

PS> Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy

(get-adgroupmember -identity 'domain.admins').name

** create account with password.
set-ADAccountPassword -Identity guest -NewPassword (convertto-securestring -asPlainText -String "PassWord12345" -Force)
**use the -path option to change the Distinguished name

Distinguished name: It's like the FQDN, it breaks down the organization of a user's permissions/groups.\

an OU (organizational unit) is more of a logical seperation, but usually doesn't have permissions?




=========================MEMORY ANALYSIS (VOLATILITY)=============================


DOWNLOADING VOLATILITY:::::

PS C:\windows\system32> invoke-webrequest -uri "https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/releases/download/v7.8.8/npp.7.8.8.Installer.x64.exe" -outfile "C:\npp.7.8.8.Installer.x64.exe" 
PS C:\windows\system32> cd C:\ 
PS C:\> start-process npp.7.8.8.Installer.x64.exe -ArgumentList '/S' 


These files should be on Public’s desktop in the Memory folder:
infected.zip has the 0zapftis.vmem file used later for the Memory Analysis challenges.
memdump.zip has cridex.vmem file used for the Volatility demo.
vol_cheatsheet.pdf is a SAN’s cheat sheet providing different use cases and command syntax for the Volatility tool.
vol_standalone contains the executable and basic docs for standalone version of Volatility used for demo and Memory Analysis challenges.



Extract Volatility to the Memory Analysis Folder:
Expand-Archive 'C:\Users\Public\Desktop\Memory\vol_standalone.zip' "$HOME\Desktop\Memory Analysis" -Force
volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe is the executable
Open a command prompt or PowerShell terminal and cd to the directory where the executable was unzipped.
Move the executable one directory up to make life easier
cd 'C:\Users\andy.dwyer\Desktop\Memory Analysis\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone\'
move-item 'C:\Users\andy.dwyer\Desktop\Memory Analysis\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe' ..
cd ..

4. Extract Memdump to Memory Analysis Folder
Expand-Archive 'C:\Users\Public\Desktop\memdump.zip' "$HOME\Desktop\Memory Analysis" -Force



.\volatility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f <path to memdump> imageinfo
** will give you some suggested profiles to try, and gives general info about the memory dump.

-h will show me all of my plugins/options
pslist will get us all processes that were running at the time of the image.
procdump will get us a sample of an executable that was running.
** then you can hash that file and see if it's malware with something like virustotal
memdump -p <proc. PID> -D .  -- will just dump the memory and show you what was going on at the time. You have to find a specifiv process to target. 
** use sysinternals tool strings to view the .dmp files. 
** use notepad++ to view memory dumps
sockets  -- view open sockets at the time of image
connscan  -- view connections at time of image
hashdump  -- dump password hashes from memory.
