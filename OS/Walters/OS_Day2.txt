OS NOTES DAY 2

Today's goal, Enumerate the windows registry, using reg.exe or regedit.exe

registry is a database of configuration data. 


regedit.exe:
	-GUI
	-Path: C:\Windows\regedit.exe

reg.exe:
	-cli
	-Path: C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe
	-Minimum commands to know:
		-reg add
		-reg query
		-reg delete
		

You can connect to a network device with regedit by going to file > connect network regustry
	** Doesn't work on these machines, I'll have to SSH
	
You can have an empty entry in the registry. 




reg.exe query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windwos\currentVersion\Run
	** this is the command  to query the run key





====================REGISTRY STRUCTURE / KEYS=======================

2. Registry structure

The Registry is comprised of Registry Hives which contain Keys, Subkeys and Values.

Keys - are known as Registry Hives and can contain subkeys and values.
Subkeys - can contain subkeys and values
Values - contain data in specific formats.


Structure of the Registry Link:::::::::::::


A registry hive is a group of keys and thier associated values that are loaded when the system is started or a specific user logs in.

There are five Registry Hives:



	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)
Contains configuration information for the entire computer. Its values are read every time the machine is started regardless of the user who logs in. 
Its subkeys are :
HARDWARE - contains a database of installed devices along with their drivers
SAM - Security Account Manager stores user and group accounts along with NTLM hashes of passwords
Security - Local Security policy accessed by lsass.exe used to determine rights and permissions for users on the machine
System - Contains keys pertaining to system startup such as programs started on boot or driver load order.




	HKEY_USERS (HKU)
Contains all all user profiles on the system. Contains one key per user on the system. Each key is named after the SID(Security Identifier) of the user.

SID values are unique to each user on the machine.

HKEY_USERS contains some of the following information:
User Environment settings for the desktop
Shortcuts
File associations

Some HKEY_USERS are called Well Known SIDs.. They identify default accounts in Windows used for various purposes. Examples include:
S-1-5-18 refers to LocalSystem account.
S-1-5-19 refers to LocalService account. It is used to run local services that do not require LocalSystem account.
S-1-5-20 refers to NetworkService account. It is used to run network services that do not require LocalSystem account.
S-1-5-21-domain-500 Refers to the built in local administrator account.





	HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)
HKEY_CURRENT_USER is the copy of the logged in user’s registry key based on thier SID from HKEY_USERS.
HKEY_USERS (HIVE)
              └──SID (S-1-5-21-3939661428-3032410992-3449649886-XXXX) (Key)
HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-3939661428-3032410992-3449649886-XXXX





HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC)
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG is a symbolic link (pointer or shortcut or alias) to the following registry key:

HKEY_Local_Machine (HIVE)
              └──SYSTEM (Key)
                      └──CurrentControlSet (Subkey)
                                    └── Hardware Profiles (Subkey)
                                                └── Current (Subkey)
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\Current






HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG is a symbolic link (pointer or shortcut or alias) to the following registry key:

HKEY_Local_Machine (HIVE)
              └──Software (Key)
                      └──Classes (Subkey)
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes

Contains file name extension associations and COM class registration information such as ProgIDs, CLSIDs, and IIDs.
It is primarily intended for compatibility with the registry in 16-bit Windows




====================================================================



**Command to get sid for all users::::::
get-localuser | select name,sid

Putting something in the run keys is one way an adversary can estasblish persistance


Minimum commands to know:::::::::::::::

Query:
Get-ChildItem cmdlet gets the items in one or more specified locations. Only shows directories/subkeys. Use get-itemproperty to see contents of entries.
Get-ItemProperty cmdlet gets the items in one or more specified locations.
**Get-Item cmdlet gets the item at the specified location. It doesn’t get the contents of the item at the location unless you use a wildcard character (*) to request all the contents of the item.
Get-item HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
** reads key values, not subkeys. 


Modify:
Set-ItemProperty cmdlet changes the value of the property of the specified item. example, changing setting to :true or :false.
Remove-ItemProperty cmdlet to delete registry values and the data that they store.

Create:
New-Item cmdlet creates a new item and sets its value. In the registry, New-Item creates registry keys and entries.
**New-Itemproperty cmdlet creates a new property for a specified item and sets its value. Typically, this cmdlet is used to create new registry values, because registry values are properties of a registry key item.


Mitre ATT&CK Framework says to check registry keys for malicious activity:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

Another form of persistance is inserting malicious powershell profiles. 



===================PSDRIVE========================

Example:
new-psdrive -Name FileServer -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\file-server\warrior share"
new-psdrive -Name HKU -PSProvider Registry -Root 'HKU'`
**now it's like another logical drive, so I can cd into it
cd Fileserver:\






==========================ALTERNATE DATA STREAMS==============================


default stream $DATA

an alternate data stream is just another place (output file) that data could be sent from a program/file.
Alternate Data Streams are impossible to stop with just permissions. However, Windows Defender can catch it.

-Deleted once copies to a fat32
-cannot be disabled
-[filename.extension]:[alternate_stream_name]::$DATA


DEMO:
write-host "Coffee runs the world." > coffee.txt
set-content coffee.txt -value "Social security number 123-45-6789" -stream secret.info
	** the social security number will go to the stream secret.info.
	






get-item .\<example file> -stream *
	** gets all the streams of a file.
get-item .\<example file> -stream <exampleStream>
	** specify one stream in place of the * to get the contents of the stream.


Adding an additional stream to a file will not change the file hash.
