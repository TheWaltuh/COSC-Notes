OS DAY 4


===================WINDOWS BOOT PROCESS======================


BIOS (Basic input output system) is the old version of UEFI 

BIOS uses bootmgr, UEFI ises mootmgrfw.efi

BIOS uses MBR, Volume boot sector, into bootloaders (bootmgr.exe, ntldr.exe), boot.ini ()

	BIOS
Step 1:
POST - basic turn on maintinance (power on self test)
Read MBR - telling computer where the boot loader is.

Step 2: 
both stages of boot loader - boot loader loads the kernel

Step 3:
NTLDR, NTDETECT, Boot.ini

Step 4:
Kernel loading

Step 5:
Starting services

Step 6:
Checking SAM by LSA


	UEFI
Step 1:
POST
GUID partition table - tells computer where the boot loader is. GPT

Step 2:
Winload.efi
winresume.efi - both of these load the kernel

Step 3:




**HAL operates between the kernel and the hardware. 


========================WINDOWS LOGON PROCESS==============================

System PID 4

SMSS.exe  - session manageer subsystem
**session 0 is non-interactive, session 1 is interactive.

SMSS.exe session 0 creates CSRSS.exe and WININIT.exe
WININIT.exe makes LSASS.exe and SVCHOST.exe

SMSS.exe session 1 creates CSRSS.exe and WINLOGON.exe
WINLOGON.exe creates LOGONUI.exe and UserINIT.exe
USERINIT.exe creates Explorer.exe 
Explorer.exe is the desktop and user interface. 

**session 0 is system and high priviege, session 1 is user level. 

CSRSS.exe is the Windows Subsystem Process.
LSASS.exe is the Local Security Authority Sub System (LSA)


======================BCDEDIT==================================

BCDEDIT: allows us to edit the boot configuration file. 

command example:
bcdedit /set {bootmgr} description "Del Taco"
**changes the description of Windows Boot Manager.

bcdedit /import C:\boot_bk

bcdedit /create {ntldr} /d "Windows XP Pro SP2 - Tiger Paw"

bcdedit /set {ntldr} device partition=C:

bcdedit /displayorder {ntldr} /addfirst

bcdedit /delete {ntldr} /f

making a safe boot:
bcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal
Undo:
bcdedit.exe /deletevalue {current} safeboot


if there are multiple boot managers, that is something to look into ;)

{current} is the default for the OS if you don't make a selection.


==========================SERVICES=================================

You can find suspicious services with sc query or get-service. Once you find it, you can edit it in the registry.

powershell:
get-service

cmd:
sc query <service>
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services | findstr <service (case sensitive)>





system processes in the boot process should not have high pids.
