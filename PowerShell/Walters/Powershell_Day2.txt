Powershell Day 2


---------CODE BLOCK-------------

code block -- enclosed in {}
Doesn't store the output of code, it stores the actual code.
call a code block by '& $VarName'



----------Sorting---------------

get-childitem | sort-object -- will sort alphabetically on process name by default.
-property length -- now it will sort on the size of the file. 
-descending -- now it's reversed. 

get-childitem | sort-object -property extension | format-table -groupby extension -- will make seperate table for each extenison, sort by extension. You need to sort first so they're next to each other so group works.

another example:
get-service | sort-object status


get-childitem | group-object {$_.length -lt 1k}  -- $_ will iterate and it will group up everything that's less than 1kn


1..10 | sort-object -property {get-random}  -- will randomize the list of # from 1-10

get-process | select-object -first 10  -- will get the first 10 lines. -last also exists.

(get-process -name csrss|select -first 1).name | get-member  -- this ends up just getting the methods and atributes of strings, because the name is a string. 

Get-Process | Group-Object {$_.Name.Substring(0,1).toUpper()} | ForEach-Object{($_.Name + " ")*7; "==========="; $_.group}
^^^ This command gets processes, groups them by first letter, and for each group, it prints the first letter neatly. 

get-process | select-object Name,ID  -- will get the processes and only display their name and ID

get-service | format-table -autosize  -- will format the table with the right sizes. 




-----------------FILTERING RESULTS-----------------------


get-service | where-object{$_.status -eq "running"}  -- lists only the running processes.

get-childitem *.txt | where-object{$_.length -gt 100}  -- list txt documents. 

Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Company -like "*micro*"} | Format-Table Name, Description, Company  -- only return proceses that are belong to companies that match *micro*
** -like could also be -notlike to get the opposite results.

Get-Process | Where-Object ProcessName -NE "Idle" | Sort-Object StartTime | Select-Object -Last 10 | Format-Table processname,starttime
-- get processes, only get non idle processes, sort them by starttime, only show the last 10, then format them  into a table with only the name and starttime.

** where-object is filetering and running a comparison, but select-object is just pulling out a whole category, you already know what you're looking for.

**get-unique will only show unique instances of an object
1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3 | sort-object | get-unique
**must be sorted to use get-unique

get-childitem | measure-object length  -- returns the length of the output of the get-childitem command. Equals the number of files in the PWD. list the amount of total objects, gets the number of files with the length attribute. 
** won't include directories in its count of files in the directory because directories don't have a length attribute. 

(get-childitem).count  -- gets the total # of objects in the output of the command. 

**example of adding in a for loop and saving that to a variable. 
$array = 1..5
$sum = 0
$array | foreach-object {$sum += $_}
$sum


$before = get-childitem
'42' > test.txt
$after = get-childitem
compare-object $before $after -property length, name
** will give you a comparison between the two variables.



-----------------CREATING OUR OWN OBJECTS--------------------


$myTruck = new-object object  
add-member -membertype NoteProperty -Name color -value red -inputobject $mytruck
			       

$mytruck = New-Object object  							-- creates new objects
										        -- new we just need to add attributes and properties
Add-Member -MemberType property -Name color -value red -InputObject $mytruck		-- This is how to add an attribute
add-member -M NoteProperty -in $mytruck -Na Make -Va Ford				-- This is the same thing but shorthand

$myTruck | add-member -Membertype Noteproperty -name model -value "F-150 Raptor"

** change a property this way:
$mytruck.model = "F-250"

$mytruck.psobject.properties.remove(<property to remove>)  -- this is how to remove a property. 

**adding a method:
$mytruck | add-member Scriptmethod Park {<code to execute here>}
** when you call it you need the parentheses, like this:
$mytruck.park()


EXAMPLE

$Marine = New-Object -TypeName pscustomobject
$Marine | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "FirstName" -Value "Andrew"
$Marine | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "LastName" -Value "Walters"
$Marine | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "Rank" -Value "LCpl"
**OR
$Marine = [PSCustomObject]@{
    "firstname" = "Andrew"
    "Lastname" = "Walters"
    "Rank" = "LCpl"
}



Get-PSProvider  -- gives you access to data you normally would not have access to. Lists all PS-providers for the current session of PS
Get-PSDrive  -- gets the psdrive

new-PSDrive -name HKU -PSProvider Registry -Root HKEY_USERS -- make a drive from a provider? 


new-psdrive -name Z -psprovider filesystem -root \\live.sysinternals.com\tools
start-service -name webclient  -- enables webclient to allow browsing of filesystems



-------------COMPARISON/LOGICAL OPERATORS--------------------

-eq -- equals, can compare anything, strings, ints, etc... no wildcards.
-ne -- Not equal. Can return every object in a collection that isn't equal to value.
-gt -- greater than
-lt -- less than
-ge -- greater or equal
-le -- less than or equal
-like -- string matches wildcard pattern
-notlike -- string dies not match wildcard pattern
-match -- string matches regex pattern
-notmatch -- string does not match regex pattern
-replace -- replaces strings matching a regex pattern
-contains -- used to see if something is in a collection of items. collection contains value.
-in -- returns true when value is contained within a collection. Same thing as contains, but the roles are reversed. value in collection.
-notin -- returns true when value is not in collection.
-is -- returns true if both objects are the same type. 
-isnot -- returns true if both objects are not the same type. 

preceding c means  -- case sensitive
preceding i means  -- case insensitive, this is the default though.

don't forget about -and, -or



Flow Control: 


if (<condition>){
	<CODE BLOCK>
}
elseif ($x -eq 2){
	<CODE BLOCK>
}
else{
	<CODE BLOCK>
}


Switch(10){

(9+1){
    write-Host "Correct"
}
(10+1){
    write-host "wrong"
}
{$_ -le 15} {
    write-host "10 is less than 15"
}
}

**This checks every case, unlike an elif which doesn't trigger if one earlier does. 
**use {} if you want a comparison operator in the case. 
**use "default" as an "else" type of case.





$nums = 1,2,3,4,5
$nums | forEach-object{$_ * 2}
2,4,6,8,10

**You can just pipe in an array to the cmdlet. 






foreach ($item in gci C:\ -recurse){$item.name}
**just another way to initialize a foreach.
**Main difference, foreach-object does the operation in real time. Normal foreach only outputs once the full command is complete. 







while ($var -ne "Marines) {
	$var = read-host "What is the best military branch?"
}
**break ends the loop alltogether
** the ++ operator works in Powershell.


$num=0
do{
$num
$num++
} while($num -lt 3)

$num=0
do{
$num
$num++
} until($num -gt 3)



for($i = 0; $i -le 255; $i++){
	write-host 192.168.0.$i
}
**like the c for loop but don't have to say int and you have different logical operators. 




------------------FILE IO------------------------------

set-content -path .\example.txt -value "A string"
get-content .\example.txt

add-content -path .\example.txt -value "append a string"
get-content .\example.txt



-----------------------HASH TABLES---------------------------


Hashtables come in key-value pairs.
$mylist = @{First = "John"; Last = "Doe"; Age = 35}


to call values:
$mylist.last
	or
$mylist["last"]


$mylist.keys  -- gets all of your keys
$mylist.values -- gets all of your values


to append/edit to hash table:
$mylist.middle = "Bon"
	or
$mylist["middle"] = "Bon"





------------------EXERCISESSS-------------------------




Create an array containing a range with a random starting and stopping point. The starting point will be a random number from -10 through 0. The ending point will be a random number from 1 through 20.
Create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse

	$top = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 20
	$bottom = Get-Random -Minimum -10 -Maximum 0

	Write-Host ($bottom..$top)
	Write-Host ($top..$bottom)







Create two empty hash tables with the following names:
    employee1
    employee2

Using the following table of key-value pairs, apply each key-value to the empty hash tables.
Table 1. keys and values 	First 		Last 		ID 		Job
				Mary		Hopper		001		Software Developer
				John		Williams	002		Web Developer
	
The keys on the first row of the table while the values are on the first column of the table
Now add a new key called Username which holds a contraction of the employee’s first initial then last name then ID. (i.e. mhopper001).
Mary got promoted to "Software Lead" so the job key for Mary needs to be changed to "Software Lead"

Create a new hash table called "employee3" that contains the following values with the respective keys.
Table 2. 
employee3 	First 	Last 	ID 	Job
		Alex	Moran	003	Software Developer

Add a new key called "Status" that holds the values:
Table 3. Status Mary 		John 		Alex
		Management	Intermediate	Entry Level
	
Make sure you use both dot notation and square brackets to manipulate your hash tables.


	$employee1 = @{
	First = "Mary"; 
	Last = "Hopper"; 
	ID = "001"; 
	Job = "Software Developer"
	}

	$employee2 = @{
	First = "John"; 
	Last = "Williams"; 
	ID = "002"; 
	Job = "Web Developer"
	}

	$employee1["Username"] = $employee1.first.Substring(0,1) + $employee1.last + $employee1.ID
	$employee2["Username"] = $employee2.first.Substring(0,1) + $employee2.last + $employee2.ID

	$employee1.Job = "Software Lead"

	$employee3 = @{
	First = "Alex"; 
	Last = "Moran"; 
	ID = "003"; 
	Job = "Software Developer"
	}

	$employee1.status = "Management"
	$employee2.status = "Intermediate"
	$employee3.status = "Entry Level"






Display the start time of the earliest and latest running processes

Identify a cmdlet that returns the current date and time then using this cmdlet and Select-object, display only the current day of the week

Identify a cmdlet that displays a list of installed hotfixes.

Extend the expression to sort the list by install date, and display only the install date and hotfix ID.

Extend the expression further, but this time sort by description, include description, hotfix ID, and install Date.


	Get-Process | Select-Object name,StartTime | where-object {$_.Name -ne 'Idle'} | sort-object -Property Starttime | Select-Object -first 1 -last 1
	Get-Date | Select-Object -Property DayOfWeek
	get-hotfix
	get-hotfix | Sort-Object -Property InstalledOn | Select-Object InstalledOn,HotfixID
	get-hotfix | Sort-Object -Property description | Select-Object description,InstalledOn,HotfixID






Create a custom object that contains information about the host system using the following:
Win32_ComputerSystem
Win32_BIOS
Win32_OperatingSystem
Win32_LogicalDisk

Use the cmdlet Get-WmiObject to obtain the needed information


	$myObject = new-object -TypeName PSCustomObject

	$myObject | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "ComputerSystem" -Value (Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem)
	$myObject | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "BIOS" -Value (Get-WmiObject Win32_BIOS)
	$myObject | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "OperatingSystem" -Value (Get-WmiObject Win32_operatingSystem)
	$myObject | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "LogicalDisk" -Value (Get-WmiObject win32_LogicalDisk)

		OR
		
	$obj = [PSCustomObject]@{
		'computername' = (get-wmiobject win32_computersystem).name
		<then the rest of the commands. The important thing is that you put everything in as a hashtable.>
	}












Find and extract the model number from the provided lines of text. If there isn’t a model number then display to the user that a model number wasn’t found

Check both lines for model numbers and report individually the line and model number if found.

Use the following variables for your script

$line1 = "Do you have model number: MT5437 for john.doe@sharklasers.com?"
$line2 = "What model number for john.doe@sharklasers.com?"


	$line1 = "Do you have model number: MT5437 for john.doe@sharklasers.com?"
	$line2 = "What model number for john.doe@sharklasers.com?"
	$pattern = "MT[\d]{4}"

	if ($line1 -match $pattern) {
	    Write-Host "line1 contains" $matches.values
	}
	else {
	    Write-Host "No number found."
	}

	if ($line2 -match $pattern) {
	    Write-Host "line2 contains" $matches.values
	}
	else {
	    Write-Host "No number found."
	}
