These notes are taken after class, because I could not get into my github account in class because I didn't bring my phone. 

We went over data types. It was just the basic stuff.

The only thing of value we went over in class was some built in functions of python:
- .split() method of strings, returns a list of strings, seperated on the character passed into the method.
- "XXX".join() method of lists, returns a string, joined with the character/string passed put between every element of that list.
- .replace("a","b") method of strings, returns a string with all "a" replaced by "b"
- Don't forget about the typecasting functions. If you make a string a list it will be a list of every individual character. 

Day's Challenges:

Exercise 1:
Use python to produce code below that will create several named variables with the specified value:

hello = "hello"
is_python_awesome = True
days_in_python = 6
pie_size = 3.14


Exercise 2:
Use Python to produce code below that will convert the provided literal ("Starting Value"), convert it to the indicated data type by using the appropriate Python Built-in Function(s), and assign the output to the named variable as designated below.

int_input = int("345")
pi_4 = float("3.1415")
hours_str = str(40)
hourly_rate = float(15)


Exercise 3:
Use python to produce code below that will create several named variables with the specified value using math operators:

x = 16
y = 3
xysum = x + y
xydiff = x - y
xyprod = x * y 
xyquo = x / y
xyintquo = int(x / y)
xymod = x % y


Exercise 4:
Use python to produce code below that will create several named variables with the specified value using the str.format member function. 
You may assign any value for the variables other than output. The output variable must use the same boilerplate text and include the 
appropriate values assigned to the first three.

name = "Jerry"
greeting = "Sir"
time = "noon"

output = "Hello {}! {}, will you be arriving by {}?".format(name, greeting, time)


Exercise 5:
    Create a variable named sentence and assign the value 'good for all'
    Turn the sentence variable into a list of individual characters and assign this to a variable named sent_list.
    Change the first (index 0) character in the list to 'f'
    Change the last (index -1) character in the list to '?'
    Combine the list into a new string with periods ('.') in between each character and assign the result to a new variable named output.
    
sentence = "good for all"
sent_list = list(sentence)
sent_list[0] = "f"
sent_list[-1] = "?"
output = ".".join(sent_list)


Exercise 6:

    Given an email address in email
    Convert the email into a list named `lst'
    The list will contain all individual parts of the email
    Example: email = 'alan.m.turing@genius.com' -> lst = ['alan','m','turing', 'genius', 'com']
    NOTE: A variable named email will be available to your code when running.
    NOTE: You must create a variable named lst which contains the required data.

lst = email.replace("@",".")
lst = lst.split(".")


Exercise 7:
    Read multiple numbers separated by spaces on the same line from the user.
    Change all spaces to a plus sign.
    Print the resulting string to the user.

userInput = input("Numbers: ")
print(userInput.replace(" ","+"))
