These notes are taken after class, because I could not get into my github account in class because I didn't bring my phone. 

We went over data types. It was just the basic stuff.

The only thing of value we went over in class was some built in functions of python:
- .split() method of strings, returns a list of strings, seperated on the character passed into the method.
- "XXX".join() method of lists, returns a string, joined with the character/string passed put between every element of that list.
- .replace("a","b") method of strings, returns a string with all "a" replaced by "b"
- Don't forget about the typecasting functions. If you make a string a list it will be a list of every individual character.
