POST EXPLOITATION:

Types of persistance:
Run Keys,
RunOnce Keys,
Scheduled tasks
/etc/crontab

If you see something in registry running powershell, check powershell profiles. Obviously, look for running processes or the script it executes first.

C2  -- command and control

look at users, user data, user information, password policy, reused passowrds.


Host Enumeration:
Linux:
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/shadow
who (shows logged on users)
groups (shows current user's groups)
ps -elf --forest
lsof
systemctl list-units --type service
ss -anob
ip route
ip neigh
ifconfig -a

Windows:
net user
net user <username>
tasklist /v (or just use task manager)
tasklist /svc (you can also use task manager for this.)
net localgroup
Run Powershell
ipconfig /all
netstat /anop
net <use, view>
arp -a
route print

look to see if the box has already been compromised.


/etc/crontab IS PERSISTANCE IN LINUX
/var/www/html is good to check for web servers.
/etc/hosts for DNS name resolution

use:
  find -iname <name>
  for finding files (case insensitive)

sudo -l 
***lists what you can sudo***

rsyslogd  -  linux process for remote logging.
