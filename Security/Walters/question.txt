Good morning/afternoon, sir.
One concern for marines in this MOS is large quantities of time spent in holding platoons, be it after MCT, at NAS Corry Station, or here at Fort Gordon.
In your view, what are the shortfalls and strengths of training command in terms of getting marines through entry level training in a timely fashion?

Training and educaiton 2030 says, "Some communities have standards for qualifications, designations, and certifications that incentivize skills progression,
but not all. We will explore how to further incentivize MOS skills progression in all communities."
What is your vision for incentivizing skills progression, and what are our current strengths and shortfalls in that area?
